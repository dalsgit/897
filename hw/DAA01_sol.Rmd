```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The aim of this exercise is just to get you familiar with creating .rmd and .pdf documents in R Markdown that you will submit for the data analysis assignments.  I recommend you use RStudio for these assignments.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

If you are using Rstudio, when you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Question 1: create a vector and dataframe

Write your own R code to create a vector with entries 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4.

```{r test vector}
test_vector = c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4)
test_vector
```


Now create an R dataframe with columns size and color, where size is the vector 12, 14, 12, 15 and color is 'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'.

```{r test data frame}
test_df = data.frame(size = c(12, 14, 12, 15), color = c("red", "blue", "green", "yellow"))
test_df
```


## Question 2: create a function in R

Write R code to create a function called "latz" which takes an integer as input.  If the integer is even, it divides the input by two and returns the result; if the integer is odd, it multiplies the input by three, adds one, and returns the result.

```{r latz function}
latz = function(input){
    if(input %% 2 == 0){
        output = input / 2
    } else{
        output = input * 3 + 1
    }
    return(output)
}
```


## Question 3: call it

Now write a loop that starts with the number 97, and calls your function "latz"" 99 times, *using the output of each call as the input of the next*, and plot the resulting 100 numbers.

```{r latz loop}
output = c(97, rep(NA, 99))
for(a in 1:99){
    output[a + 1] = latz(output[a])
}
plot(output)
```


Compute the mean and variance of these 100 numbers using the built-in R functions.

```{r mean and variance}
mean(output)
var(output)
```


Finally submit BOTH your .rmd file and the resulting .pdf file with Canvas as Data Analysis Assignment 1.
